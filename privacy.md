### Information You Provide
  Calendly collects the following information, either directly from Users, Invitees, or Viewers:
  #### Your Telegram username and ID
  #### Your Telegram display name
Appointment Information. A User may voluntarily give us certain information when scheduling and setting up appointments. This can include name, email address, phone number; email addresses of other people; the subject of the meeting; and any other information a User provides or collects upon scheduling, pursuant to the Calendly Terms of Use. Calendly processes the information an Invitee provides to a User when scheduling with the User on the User’s behalf as a processor or service provider.

Calendar Availability. A User may connect their calendar with Calendly. Our calendar integration only checks the duration and free/busy status of the events in your calendar so that we don’t book you when you’re busy. We never store details about the appointments in your connected calendar, such as who you are meeting with, their email address, or the meeting title. Although connecting your calendar to our services makes the scheduling process much more efficient, you are not required to connect your calendar to use our services. More information about access the Calendly app and extensions have to your connected calendar is available here.

Account and Billing Information. Users provide Calendly with certain information, including name, email address, username, and password, when you set up your account. If you purchase a premium version of Calendly, our third party payment processors will collect and store your billing address and credit card information. We store the last four digits of your credit card number, card type, and the expiration date.

Marketing Information. Users, Invitees, or Viewers interested in Calendly’s services may contact us through forms made available on the Website and voluntarily give information such as name, work email, phone number, company, and role. Users, Invitees, or Viewers interested in our newsletter may also submit their name and email addresses to join our mailing list. We also receive other similar information provided by you if you participate in an event hosted by Calendly or its partners (such as webinars) and in your interactions with our social media accounts.
